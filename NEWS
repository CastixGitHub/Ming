0.2.1

* Added support for pymongo 1.7+
* New syntax for connection strings (mongodb://host:port[,host:port])
* Separated database argument to DataStore (no longer embedded in connection string)
* By default, more relaxed about extra keys in docs coming from the database
   (allow_extra=True, strip_extra=True is now the default when querying)
